Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:     From the simulation with N= 1000 to the one with N=10000, I was expecting a more linear increase in time. However, the second simulation mentioned took considerably more time to be executed than my prediction was expecting.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: Considering that the predictions get more accurate as the number of simulation increases, I would try to find a good balance between number of simulation and cost be choosing N=100000
